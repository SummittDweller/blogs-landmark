Greetings from central Iowa!  

My geocaching names are *Summitt Dweller* and *Iowa.Landmark*. I have two accounts/names because I'm both a "player" and a "community volunteer reviewer".  

*Summitt Dweller* is a charter member at [Geocaching.com](http://geocaching.com) and a co-founder, past president, and long-time webmaster of the venerable [Iowa Geocachers' Organization](https://iowageocachers.org).  As *Summitt Dweller*, I joined the geocaching community on 18-Feb-2002, and logged my first find on a date that's easy to remember, because it's a palindrome (if written just right)... 20-02-2002.  That's **February 20, 2002**, almost 16 years ago!    

*Iowa.Landmark* is my reviewer account.  Yes, I'm the guy who reviews most of the geocaches submitted for review in Iowa, and I've been a reviewer since October 2014.

I'm preparing this blog space with the hope of adding some reviewer's perspectives here over time, so future posts here will be almost exclusively from *Iowa.Landmark*, not *Summitt Dweller*.  After all, *SD* will be out geocaching with no time to write, at least when he's not at work.

If you came here hoping to find the [Iowa Geocachers' Organization web site](https://iowageocachers.org), and wonder what's up, then my next post will probably be of interest, and you won't have to wait long for it either.

Until next time... take care.

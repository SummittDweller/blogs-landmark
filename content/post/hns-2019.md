Passing along this note from IGO President, Mike Hogle...

It's my pleasure to inform you that Hike-N-seek 2019 will be held in Lynn County and more specifically the Cedar Rapids area on September 13th-15th 2019. Make sure to mark your calendars, as the date has changed since the supporting members were notified two weeks earlier.

I would also like to add that our website IowaGeocachers.org is currently down and you can check on it's status and get a better understanding of what is happening here: https://iowageocachers.org/


Thank you,
IGO President
Mike Hogle

Until next time... take care.

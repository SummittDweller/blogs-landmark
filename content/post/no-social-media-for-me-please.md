I hear rumors that there have been some issues with the IGO's social media accounts lately.  Honestly, I don't know what they are, and really don't want to know.  Please, do NOT be offended if you are fond of social media and enjoy using it; I'm glad for you, but I'd rather not participate myself.  And please, do NOT be offended if you are my friend and feel hurt if I don't follow you on social media or respond to your requests.  I care deeply about the IGO and the Iowa geocaching community in general, but I won't be sharing that sentiment, or any other, on social media, ever again.

I feel a little odd sharing this online, but I know that many of you use social media and might wonder about my lack of participation there.  It's a long story, but the shortened version goes something like this...

I used to do a little work with social media platforms, mostly Facebook and Twitter, and had hundreds of “friends” and even more followers. Most of my interaction was with, or on behalf of, non-profit organizations that host "pages" or accounts on these platforms. I also had a small personal niche in social media and when my son died in October 2012 that was nice to have, at least at first.  My list of “friends” swelled after Ian's accident, but there were times when some of the crap that got posted by “friends” of my “friends” was very hurtful.  I felt very bad for the young man/driver who hit Ian and ultimately caused his accidental death. I wanted nothing from this man, except to avoid destroying his family-life.  There was a lot of online banter about the accident, but no real facts, just opinions.  I believe some of the online discussion could have cost the driver, and my family, everything we had left. Over time I managed to ignore most of the BS, but some of it still haunts me.  

In 2016, while still a member of the local school board, we had a contentious personnel issue, one that legally and rightfully had no place in the public eye.  Lots of folks I’d never met, and who never bothered to talk to me or even come to a school board meeting, launched opinionated attacks online.  That, coupled with all the 2016 political crap on FB caused me to *try* and pull-the-plug… I just wanted to be done with all the bull, but that turned out to be harder than expected, too.  

My son’s FB account is still open and I don’t feel it's fair to close that even if I could; some of his friends and family still use it to reach out and share memories.  I welcome and treasure those posts.  I also have contacts overseas who depend on FB and Messenger to communicate with me, occasionally, so I left my accounts open but dramatically reduced my number of “friends” to just a few, mostly family. I rarely look at posts unless someone specifically "mentions" me, and I never open or accept new requests.  Thankfully, I no longer get 100’s of notifications each day.  

I believe my life is better now that social media isn't a significant part of it.

None of this drama ever involved the IGO, or the geocaching community that I know.  If you are a geocaching friend, as many of you are, please don't feel like my opinion of social media or my actions are because of you; my geocaching interests and friends were simply caught up in a much bigger mess.

If you use social media, I hope you do so wisely, and more importantly, with kindness. Social media can be a wonderful tool, but please be careful what you write, and by all means, critically and thoughtfully filter what you read no matter the source.

Until next time... take care.

This morning I finally got this blog to *auto-build* and update whenever I push changes to my Git repository. It's not necessary that you understand all that; it basically means "this is a test".

But, while you are here... 

If this is your first visit to my blog I encourage you to read "from the bottom up", beginning with [Welcome to Iowa.Landmark's Blog](https://iowageocachers.org/blog/post/welcome-to-iowa-landmarks-blog/).  And please do write and let me know what you think.  You can send email to either [admin@iowageocachers.org](mailto:admin@iowageocachers.org) or [iowa.landmark.60@gmail.com](mailto:iowa.landmark.60@gmail.com).

Until next time... take care.
